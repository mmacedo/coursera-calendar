# Coursera Calendar #

Simple application that displays a calendar with user's courses.

## Motivation ##

Coursera's courses are cool, but it has too many good courses. A calendar view can give a Coursera user the opportunity of weighting their interest in a course against their availability of time.

## Technical Goal ##

Developed in node.js with a handmade web application framework. The technological goal of the application is for me to grok every part of the framework development by heart, developing the simplest (not easier) and most complete web framework possible. The usage of top pre-processors is mandatory.

## Coursera ##

Coursera doesn't have an public API. The data is retrieved server side through their Backbone JSON API's.
